This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Hack's type system related to null values and arithmetic operations.  The `foo` function is declared to accept an optional integer (`?int`), but the type checker doesn't prevent a `null` value from being passed in and used in an arithmetic operation, resulting in a runtime error.  The `bug.hack` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.hack` provides a corrected version demonstrating how to prevent the error by explicitly handling null values.
